# About

This series is all about creating polymorphich code. True polymorphic code which is changed everytime 
it runs. I want to mess around with the following techniques:

* Encryption
* Different Encodings
* Changing the memory mappings

To better understand this I want to program these both in C and then Assembly.

I want to also see if this can be utilized as a sort of library which can be implemented in other projects
for easier polymorphich categories. This should be possible.
